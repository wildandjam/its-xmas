# [JavaScript Image Upload][demo]

This is the source code for the [JavaScript Image Upload Demo][demo] which I wrote about on [my website][writing] in July 2013.

I updated the article, and this demo in August 2014.

I am using the [JavaScript Canvas to Blob][canvas-to-blob] polyfill for the demo.
